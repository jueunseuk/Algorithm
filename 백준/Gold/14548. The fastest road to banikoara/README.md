 <p>The first line of input contains a single integer P, (1 ≤ P ≤ 1000), which is the number of data sets that follow. Each data set begins with a line containing the number N of the remaining lines in the dataset (1 ≤ N ≤ 500), followed by a space, followed by the name of a departure town, followed by a space, followed by the name of a destination town.
